We interrupt our regularly scheduled programming to bring you this breaking news... Truly. I was going to write a post on the book Team Topologies I read for [book club](https://brianchambers.substack.com/p/chamber-of-tech-secrets-757). Now, that will be pushed to next week. :)

## Preconditions

Our hot water heater had stopped working, and we were thinking it was probably the heating element. I got some advice to at least call a plumber and see what they would charge since it was a bit tedious to do the repair. When the plumber came out, he also checked the house water pressure. It was around 95 PSI when it should have been under 80 to prevent damage to the interior plumbing. We knew we wanted the hot water heater fixed, and the water pressure issue seemed to be a problem waiting to happen if not addressed.

## ROI Analysis

The quote came back later that day at $984 for hot water heater repair, expansion tank replacement, and pressure reducing valve replacement. Add on another $225 for a second expansion tank replacement in the crawlspace, and that puts the total to over $1,200.

My initial estimate for the DIY route was $230 in parts and $110 in tools. That included a splurge on a not-completely-necessary Fluke clamp multimeter. I wanted to verify the hot water heater was turned off without touching it with voltage probes since it runs on 240 volts and I wanted to be super careful. I could have bought a $10 clamp ammeter at Harbor Freight, but I took the opportunity to upgrade my Amazon multimeter to a nice Fluke that can also measure DC amperage with the clamp. That might prove useful in the future for some ham radio projects.

## Risk Analysis

I was well aware of how damaging water can be to a house, so part of the condition for taking on this plumbing project was knowing there was minimal damage to be done if a small leak happened in the garage or crawlspace. Little did I know the magnitude of what would transpire! I hedged my bets by researching and building a gallon drain bucket with a hose attached at the bottom like a rain barrel. Theoretically, this would allow me to drain an unlimited amount of water out of the pipes since I didn't know how much would be left in them after running the faucets and hose spigots dry.

Once I felt prepared on the electrical safety and water drainage fronts, I was ready to go.

## Implementation

I split the project into three phases: hot water heater, pressure reducing valve, and expansion tanks. I tried to do them when my wife and kids were out of the house since they all involved turning off the whole house water supply.

The expansion tank under the house had gone bad and the bladder completely filled with water. That was a small consolation that the mess I caused was somehow worth it.

## Reflections

Clean up your mess! Don't let someone else (or your future self) bear the consequences of your learning and experimentation. I spent two hours sopping up standing water on the plastic sheets in the crawlspace to avoid mold.

I spent roughly 15 hours on this project: 4 for hot water heater elements replacement, 7 for the pressure reducing valve replacement, and 4 for replacing the expansion tanks. I could have hurried more, but tried to take it at a measured pace and not rush. I ended up spending $500 including the additional PEX piping, adapters, and crimp tools. This resulted in a final savings of $700 our an hourly rate of around $45. It tool longer than expected, but the cost savings was only one goal. The other goal was learning more about how things work and setting myself up with new skills for the future. The project definitely fulfilled the learning objective, so I'm calling it a win.
