We interrupt our regularly scheduled programming to bring you this breaking news... Truly. I was going to write a post on the book Team Topologies I read for book club. Now, that will be pushed to next week. :)

## Preconditions

## ROI Analysis

## Risk Analysis

I was well aware of how damaging water can be to a house, so part of the condition for taking on this plumbing project was knowing there was minimal damage to be done if a small leak happened in the garage or crawlspace. Little did I know the magnitude of what would transpire!

I hedged my bets by researching and building a hose outlet 5 gallon bucket, like a rain barrel. Theoretically, this would allow me to drain an unlimited amount of water out of the pipes since I didn't know how much would be left in them after running the faucets and hose spigots dry.

## Implementation

The expansion tank under the house had gone bad and the bladder completely filled with water. That was a small consolation that the mess I caused was somehow worth it.

## Reflections

Clean up your mess! Don't let someone else (or your future self) bear the consequences of your learning and experimentation. I spent two hours sopping up standing water on the plastic sheets in the crawlspace. When I was done, most of

I spent roughly 15 hours on this project: 4 for hot water heater elements replacement, 7 for the pressure reducing valve replacement, and 4 for replacing the expansion tanks. I could have hurried more, but tried to take it at a measured pace and not rush.
