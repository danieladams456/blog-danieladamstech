I'm writing this post for later while flying home. The decision to come back or stay was hard, but I think I made the right choice. I had been down in Florida for six days. While I was able to support and help the rest of the family, I hadn't yet gotten to see Daddy due to COVID visiting restriction of a single static person for the duration of the hospitalization. It was the status of having a flight out this morning that lead them to make an exception last night and let me in for a couple of hours.

I couldn't make out all of what he said, but some parts that I did I wrote down so I could remember. I know he knew I was there and could hear everything I told him. I'm glad I could have this time to interact with him rather than only being let in during a bad emergency where he wouldn't have known I was there and loved him. He said something about "heart" a couple times, I think in the metaphorical sense instead of immediate medical sense. He said "it's serious" and "don't have much longer."

Me: "I think you're a good dad."
Daddy: "I try. I love you very much."
Me: "I love you very much too."

I cried a good bit there with him (and some while writing this), and I could see his eyes tearing up as well. He said, "I wanted to be there for you." I think he has done a great job of that. His dad died from a heart attack when Daddy was a young kid, like 6 or 7 I think. Because of that and a history of heart issues due to diet in his family history, he made sure to eat super healthy and exercise a lot. Whenever we'd do a treat and get Pizza Hut growing up, we'd always order a half for him with "light cheese, chicken, and green peppers."

Daddy always made sure to spend a lot of time with us. I remember when we'd be working on the yard as a kid raking leaves, he and David would talk college football and player statistics. He was always supportive of my interests as well, whether it was cameras, video editing, computer programming, or now ham radio. He specifically wanted to get me something for my radio for my birthday this year.

I'm thankful for all the doctors and care he's had over the last 7 years. Mommy told me last night that Natasha the PA in Tampa they have become good friends with let her call and process a couple nights ago. There have been numerous other doctors that have put in a lot of work and care in his treatment. He's had multiple rounds of chemo, radiation, an auto transplant, immunotherapy clinical trial, a donor transplant, and chemo maintenance pills. Florian, his donor from Germany, has been a huge contributor for the three years of cancer free time he has had. He and I have gotten to be friends and talk regularly.

Last night God brought Psalm 23:1-4 to my mind:
"The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me."

We don't know how long this will last. Right now we're trying to get Daddy strengthened back up to be able to continue treatment, but only God knows what is future is. He has a swallow study at 1:30 today. That will let us know if he can start back on his chemo maintenance that can only be given in pill form.

This morning I was reading in Acts about Paul's third missionary journey. Acts 23:11 says:
"And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, 'Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou has testified of my in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.'"
God knows what plans he has for us and when we have accomplished all that He has for us to do. Daddy has been a good witness throughout this whole process, and now is ready for whatever God has next for him.
