I was thinking about how to best chronicle my time so far in tech showcasing the variety of contributions I have delivered. After thinking it through, I came up with the idea of a graph showing my focus between the areas of software, data, cloud, and security.

I had the look I wanted in mind but wasn't sure how to implement it. My first concent was a stacked bar graph with variable width bars depending on my time in the position. Stacked bar graphs were easy, but there did not seem to be many examples out there about how to do one with variable width bars. [The Python Graph Gallery](https://python-graph-gallery.com/) lead me to realize a [stacked area chart](https://python-graph-gallery.com/251-stacked-area-chart-with-seaborn-style/) would get me the look I was after. By increasing the number of points, the shape would asymptotically approach a variable width stacked bar graph. Repeating each entry for the number of months gave me a good look (and was logical as well!) Removing the percentile ticks on the Y axis and customizing labels and positioning on the X axis completed the graph.

### My Tech Journey

This is some context you won't find on my [Linkedin profile.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danieladams15/)

My first introduction to programming when I tool AP Computer Science in 11th grade. Ever since then, I was hooked. When looking at colleges and scholarships, I came across a program with the NSA that would have been a scholarship, summer internships, and a job after college. I made it to the last round up at Fort Meade including full scope poly for TS/SCI clearance, but didn't get the offer. I still liked the cyber security angle. During college, I participated in our cyber defense team. Our team placed [2nd in the 2014 Mid-Atlantic Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition.](https://maccdc.org/maccdc-2014/) During college, I did a 8 month full-time co-op with Babcock and Wilcox mPower on their [small modular reactor](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rodadams/2017/03/13/bechtel-and-bwxt-quietly-terminate-mpower-reactor-project/) building UI prototypes for control room operators. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission was not approving projects around that era, so the next summer I moved on to Genworth with a endpoint security internship.

After college, I started the IT Leadership Development Program. This program included four 6-month rotations on different teams to broaden my horizons and help pick the area that was the best fit for roll-off. I started out in Richmond working on Box and OneDrive data loss prevention. Then I worked on the ETL team where I took fraud records from Hive and sent them to an ESB to ingest the data back into the transactional system. During this time, [Atul Saurav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atulsaurav/) was a great mentor teaching me a lot about data. Still thinking I wanted to stay a security guy, I moved down to Raleigh for an application security rotation on the Mortgage Insurance business unit's security team. I've been here in Raleigh ever since! The cloud was a hot new topic at that time. After hearing there was a team working on AWS and they had recently launched a new EMR based analytics platform, I worked towards getting on that team. My thought was that this would be an opportunity to move security earlier into the design phase rather than trying to fix it after the fact. I created a [git repo with terraform labs](https://github.com/danieladams456/aws-labs) I worked on in the evenings to show I was serious about learning AWS. This was around the time AWS ALBs were coming out and the company was migrating off a Consul-based stack to them, so in my labs I built a [two-tier alb system](https://github.com/danieladams456/aws-labs/tree/master/dual_alb) for public and private services. When I presented my initiative to [Chris,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherdsmith76/details/experience/) at that time Director of Architecture and now CTO, he gave me the opportunity to rotate on his team. At one point in the six month rotation (and trial for remaining on the team) as I was working through the various projects, he said, "as long as you keep hitting it out of the park, I'll keep giving you more stuff to try."

Roll-off time came, and I received an offer to stay on the Enterprise Architecture team. I was very thankful for the opportunity! [Mark](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-griffin-8760b31/) and [Mike,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-lyon-13899/) the most senior individual contributors who had worked as a team of two for the previous 10 years, let me join them. It was a great learning opportunity to be around them during the early years of building out our cloud environment. Guiding principles were codification of everything, strong environment parity, and cross environment/business context isolation. That team functioned as the [cloud center of excellence](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/what-is-cloud-center-excellence-why-should-your-organization-create-one/) and delivered big projects partnering with the various development teams. As the obviously junior member, the projects were more internal-facing platform elements, but there were some that started working on my influence skills across teams. One of those was leading the migration from DataDog to NewRelic (back when they had the strongest APM and distributed tracing offering) and then driving adoption across all our development teams. We rolled it out successfully, and years later I am still the go-to SME on performance monitoring. (Currently I lead a cross-team monitoring focus group sharing best practices and helping others level-up our monitoring across all our apps.) Other projects of interest was working with other teams (including HQ approvals) to build out our business unit's own ADFS cluster primarily for federating to AWS. This was years before IAM Identity Center, so I built a utility site allowing us to use SAML roles with CLI and SDK access. It was a server-side rendered site built on Lambda and API Gateway that parsed the SAML assertion and presented a similar screen to the main AWS sign in (though with Bootstrap styling). Users could click a role and the AWS JS browser SDK would call STS for temporary credentials. These were rendered into a cross-platform set of `aws configure` commands that could easily be pasted into a terminal to refresh the appropriate profile. I also worked on a proposed enterprise-wide API fronting a tokenization provider. Circumstances changed and that project was implemented at another time with another solution, but it was fun writing that service and thinking through the use cases. That was the position I stayed in the longest at 3 years, trying to learn by doing and osmosis from the experienced people around me.
