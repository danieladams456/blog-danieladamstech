Last weekend I was painting the boys' room and signed up for an Audible trial for some longer-form content than my typical podcasts. I'm not the fastest painter, clocking about 5 hours for cleaning, taping, and clean up and 6 for painting. But in the end, the room looked good and the boys were very happy. As I mentioned before, I listened to

Staff Engineer Archetypes (**TODO** compare with Staff Engineer's path)

- Tech Lead: drives 1-2 team's planning and execution, unblock along the way as needed via mentoring. Roughly 1 per 8 engineers so very common.
- Architect: direction, quality, approach within a specific critical domain. See [Brian Chambers Theory of Waves.](https://brianchambers.substack.com/p/chamber-of-tech-secrets-5)
- Solver: digs deep into arbitrarily complex problems and find a path forward. Can bounce around if that's what the organization needs.
- Right Hand (can't resist the [Hamilton reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uGG7Sgwz4Q)): provide additional bandwidth to leaders of organizations by acting on their behalf. Requires tight alignment.

What do staff engineers do? Mentoring, building technical brand, advocating for burning down tech debt while balancing delivering business value. One theme in various leveling rubrics is the time horizon of assignments get longer at the higher levels. Feedback cycles also slow down commensurately, so the engineer has to have good judgement and ability to glean non-obvious queues to inform adjustments to trajectory. There are benefits to be at a Staff+ level. The title allows you to stop wasting effort proving your seniority. Interviews found this more common with women and minorities. You are also more likely to be allowed access to ["the room where it happens."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMD14n4UOVQ) There's also increased agency to pick projects, but that comes with higher accountability for alignment of impact from those projects. Don't get too comfortable working on easy and low impact instead of going for hard and high impact. There is a subset of this low-impact work that is high visibility. Too much optimization for visibility can also be a pitfall. "Visibility is a transient currency. Learning and developing yourself is a permanent one; focus on the latter once you've done the minimum to clear the former's cliff." ([quote](https://staffeng.com/guides/being-visible/))

Effecting change is a goal of a Staff engineer. The book contained a full section on methods for driving improvement in technical quality. One principle was to start with small, concrete changes that can layer on each other rather than rolling out a multifaceted program all at once. Engineers will be able to digest and internalize the slow, steady pace of change more effectively than split attention would allow. Another benefit of stepwise change is it allows monitoring the target metrics along the way to understand when a change moved the needle in a positive direction versus non-significant change or regression. Interesting but informative SOX joke quote: "It doesn't reduce risk, just makes it more clear who to blame when things go wrong." Beyond audit requirements, we must make sure processes we are creating actually reduce risk and not just service to point out problems after the fact.

Create space for others. The way a Staff engineer can be most valuable to his or her employer is to have a multiplicative effect on others. In order to let others flourish and solve problems on their own, you need to not be involved in everything. I have made the mistake in the past of being involved in too many decisions that it became hard to pull back. Make your feedback non-blocking on a document or code review (i.e. label as "nit"). This lets people assimilate what you're saying while still exercising their own power of decision and building that muscle. When you do make a decision, write down the thinking process and research paths that lead to that decision. Even supporting arguments for the decision do not do the same level of bringing others along in the reasoning process than laying out the various paths of research. This still needs to be balanced and well organized to keep the reader on track.

Organizational authority is loaned, not given. It can be retracted. Using it depends on staying aligned with the sponsor that gave it to you. This idea of stewarding the responsibility you were given also applies to "remaining in the room." A character quality that applies to both async decision-making (RFPs, code reviews) as well as in-person interactions in "the room" is being low friction to work with. Someone used their social capital to invite you into the room. You should act in a way that makes the other members respect your sponsor's judgement call of involving you. One of the most important things (especially for opinionated people such as myself) is not sucking the oxygen out of the room. No one else wants to work in that environment. The second most important takeaway from this section was about being understood. I LOVE this [quote](https://staffeng.com/guides/getting-in-the-room/): "Keep in mind that it's your obligation to be understood, not the obligation of everyone else to understand you."

Concise speaking lets you contribute more ideas in less time.

In a similar vein, Tuesday afternoon I watched a Staff Engineering panel on Zoom. It was super inspiring to hear what some of the people were building. They were also most all right around my age, younger than I was expecting for people so senior. One resource I would suggest following is [Ryan Peterman's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanlpeterman/) newsletter [developing.dev](https://www.developing.dev/). It is short yet hits on important topics.
