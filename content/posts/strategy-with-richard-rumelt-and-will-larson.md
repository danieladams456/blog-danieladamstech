I've been following Will Larson for a while at this point. I read his book [Staff Engineer,](https://staffeng.com/book/) listened through the associated [podcast,](https://podcast.staffeng.com/), follow [his blog,](https://lethain.com/) and listened to his [talk on strategy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkfzpQ10eI4) I was excited to see [his interview](https://www.lennyspodcast.com/the-engineering-mindset-will-larson-carta-stripe-uber-calm-digg/) pop up on Lenny's podcast recently.

Then, I heard Lenny's [interview with Richard Rumelt](https://www.lennyspodcast.com/good-strategy-bad-strategy-richard-rumelt/) and thought Richard had a straight-forward, practical approach to thinking about strategy. It's interesting tracing the lineage of ideas - Richard Rumelt's mental model was similar to what I had heard from Will Larson. It makes sense; Will had read and drawn on two of Richard's books. He has blog posts [Notes from "Good Strategy, Bad Strategy"](https://lethain.com/good-strategy-bad-strategy/) and [Notes on The Crux.](https://lethain.com/notes-on-the-crux/) I'm going to keep this post short since I don't have much of anything to add to the discussion. These are just the highlights that most stood out me.

Strategy has 3 components:

1. Accurate and honest diagnosis
2. Guiding policy
3. Coherent and consistent action

Diagnosis

Guiding Policy

Action

A clarifying, alternative term for strategy is "Action Agenda" (aligning with [Amazon's leadership principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles), Bias for Action.) "Action Agenda" emphasizes that the only useful strategy is one that moves people to action. A strategy that just sits there looking good on paper will not accomplish anything.

When contemplating a new project or finding yourself in a competitive position, tackle the crux. [The Crux](https://hardclimbs.info/what-is-a-crux-in-climbing/) is the hardest part of rock climb. Richard drew the parallel of if you can't handle the crux of a climb, you shouldn't do the climb at all. Similarly, not being able to tackle the crux of a product or business problem means you should probably table the idea. You don't want to waste waste effort on other portions of the sequence if you can't make it to completion.

That isn't to say we should just be giving up. An encouraging piece of advice was to "Pick a problem that aligns with your ambition but is also reasonable to do something about." Finding that most important problem where you can move the needle and taking consistent action will almost always lead to improvement. A similar angle stated "Focus power on a target you can affect." The key word is power. When asked what power is, Richard said it is a way that you're different from the competition that you can exploit as an asymmetry.
