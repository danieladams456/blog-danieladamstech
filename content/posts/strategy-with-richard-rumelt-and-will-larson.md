I've been following Will Larson for a while at this point. I read his book [Staff Engineer,](https://staffeng.com/book/) listened through the associated [podcast,](https://podcast.staffeng.com/), follow [his blog,](https://lethain.com/) and listened to his [talk on strategy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkfzpQ10eI4) I was excited to see [his interview](https://www.lennyspodcast.com/the-engineering-mindset-will-larson-carta-stripe-uber-calm-digg/) pop up on Lenny's podcast recently.

Then, I heard Lenny's [interview with Richard Rumelt](https://www.lennyspodcast.com/good-strategy-bad-strategy-richard-rumelt/) and thought Richard had a straight-forward, practical approach to thinking about strategy. It's interesting tracing the lineage of ideas - Richard Rumelt's mental model was similar to what I had heard from Will Larson. It makes sense; Will had read and drawn on two of Richard's books. He has blog posts [Notes from "Good Strategy, Bad Strategy"](https://lethain.com/good-strategy-bad-strategy/) and [Notes on The Crux.](https://lethain.com/notes-on-the-crux/)
