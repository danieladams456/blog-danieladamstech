Two things are coming together in this moment to make me want to write a blog. One has been a desire for a while, and the other, a recent realization of necessity.

## Writing

The more recent but more driving factor is improving my writing. Several of the sources I read and listen to have been emphasizing the importance of writing lately. Brian Chambers, chief enterprise architect at Chick-fil-a, has [advocated for writing in public](https://brianchambers.substack.com/p/chamber-of-tech-secrets-10). One of the resources linked in his post is [Matt Rickard's blog](https://blog.matt-rickard.com/), which I now follow. Brian's description is:

> Matt writes every day and is incredible at cross-disciplinary pattern matching. I was amazed to learn he writes these super-technical posts in ~20 minutes a day. 🤯

This reminded me of the book [Range](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/41795733) my brother got me for christmas a couple years ago. I don't read enough to be truly good at cross-disciplinary pattern matching, but it is a long term goal. [The Staff Engineer's Path](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-staff-engineers/9781098118723/) (recommended by [Gergely Orosz](https://www.pragmaticengineer.com/)) championed writing as the way to scale influence across a large tech org. Several recent [Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast) episodes have featured writers who have encouraged others to develop that skill as well.

And we all know about Hamilton's writing thanks to Lin-Manuel Miranda! ⭐️🕺🏻🎶
