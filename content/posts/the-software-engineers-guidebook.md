## Takeaways

- own your own career
  - what percent of time should I be coding vs not coding
  - high leverage direction-setting non-coding tasks vs getting too distracted with project management tasks that it slows down my feature throughput.
  - mentee relationship: I had been scared to sign up for the formal program since I was worried I'd run out of intelligent questions halfway through the year. I took the plunge in 2023, and both my mentors have been very friendly and gracious. I switched partway through the year since my first mentor took a position as VP of Sales with around 140 reports at another company.
