This is the last post chronicling the reading of the book [_Influence_](https://www.influenceatwork.com/) by Dr. Robert Cialdini. The first was an introduction and question of [influence vs. persuasion](https://blog.danieladamstech.com/2023/influence-or-persuasion/), and the next covered the first four "weapons of influence": [contrast, reciprocation, commitment plus consistency, and social proof.](https://blog.danieladamstech.com/2023/influence-book-part-2/) Continuing on, here we cover liking, authority, and scarcity.

### Chapter 5: Liking

It is better to be liked than not liked. Surprise! But what types of liking are there? The books lists five: physical attractiveness, similarity, compliments, contact plus cooperation, and association. The various "liking" factors can produce a halo effect where one aspect of a person is noticed and prevents the observer from seeing a more wholistic picture. Halo effect is one of the [performance review biases](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/performance-review-biases/) covered in Gergely Orosz's [The Software Engineer's Guidebook.](https://www.engguidebook.com/) I just received my copy last week! I need to finish up a couple of other in-progress books on my [book list,](https://blog.danieladamstech.com/book-list/) and then I will read that one.

Working towards positive outcomes with teamwork leads to liking. As you can imagine, two cabins of boys at camp can develop a rivalry, especially if there are competitive games between the groups. Once this competitive spirit has grown, it can lead to negative connotations and attacks on the personal character of the other group. A research study let this feeling mount and then tested how effectively it could be reversed. To trigger the reversal, the researchers constructed scenarios where the two groups of boys needed to work together. These situations included the food transport truck being stuck and an issue with the water pipes. Both situations lead to the groups working together to come to a solution.

In the corporate world, related but separate teams can come together to accomplish something and build interpersonal bonds. Many times, different teams working on the same project are approaching it from different angles. This leads them to value different things on the way towards the common goal. Team-building activities can proactively strengthen relationships and lead to higher levels of empathy for counterpart team's objectives and methods. When I was on the Cloud/Data Engineering team, the Data Engineering team and the Enterprise Data Management Office team volunteered together several times at the local food bank. Now I'm on the Strategic Customer Technology (Integrations) team. Just last week we did a full day [Habitat for Humanity house build](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7128544886449983488/) with our business-side counterpart, the Customer Solutions team.

### Chapter 6: Authority

The prime research example

### Chapter 7: Scarcity

All these principles of influence trace back to shortcuts our mind uses to make decision-making easier. Unless manipulated, they are usually a proxy of logical decision processes. We all are familiar with the relationship between supply and demand. Thus we associate scarcity (low supply) as driven by high demand. On a slightly different angle taking into account both supply and demand, if many others are buying the item, we assume it is priced correctly on the supply/demand curve (or is the [efficient frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_frontier) in investing.)

This manipulation can cause someone to ignore the remainder of the value proposition and focus too much on the proxy of availability. During college, the author's brother made money by selling cars. But the fascinating part was he bought and flipped them through the same newspaper's classified section. How could he consistently sell the car for more than he had paid for it? The secret was scheduling all prospective buyers to come at the same time. This caused a heightened sense of scarcity which would not have been present with individual showings. When two or three people showed up, he would line them up by order of arrival and say they must wait until the person ahead of them in line had made his or her purchase decision. This added "now or never" pressure to the situation and would cause even partially interested buyers to pay the full asking price for fear the person behind them in line would take the deal if they walked away.

One signal indicative of if one should completely disregard scarcity is the contrast between _owning_ something rare vs _using_. The latter does not change whether an item is rare or plentiful. We should step back and ask ourselves the purpose of buying a particular item, and if we should be influenced by scarcity. I'm an amateur radio operator, and some hams can border on collectors. For one person, having a first-ten serial number or a [limited edition morse code paddle](https://www.i2rtf.com/eclipse-2016.html) means something. Another person may only be concerned about the performance of the item. Knowing that you fall into the second camp can help you attempt to distance yourself from scarcity influence.
