[_Influence_](https://www.influenceatwork.com/) by Dr. Robert Cialdini covers some useful and intriguing psychological constructs that shape how we act in society. As I mention in my [previous post,](/2023/influence-or-persuasion/) one must take care in applying ethics to the situation and analyzing which subset of tactics is acceptable.

Below I walk through the book by chapter highlighting topics and examples that I found interesting.

### Chapter 1

One theme this book exposes is the subconcious things we would be surprised influence us but actually do. There are emperical studies throughout the book supporting the various points. Take these three requests in the context of waiting in line for a copier and asking to skip to the font.

- "Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I'm in a rush?" 94% success
- "Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine?" 60% success
- "Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I have to make some copies?" 93% success

One would assume that being in a rush would lead to a greater chance of skipping in line, but it really was the trigger word _because_.

Contrast principle: much more likely to purchase a $95 sweater after purchasing a $495 suit than the other way around. The same thing applies to realtors showing overpriced, dilapidated properties leading up to the "good" deal they want to sell their clients on. The contrast fresh in the client's mind makes him or her see the benefits of the final house after the setup sequence.

Another theme of the book is that humans use pattern matching and take shortcuts to make sense of the world. For example, expensive=good. If we analyzed everything from first principles every time, we would function at the speed required to make decisions in normal life. The obvious observation this raises is we generally think of stereotyping as bad, but this emotionless observation says it is required to function in life. I have some questions. Is there something else we can categorize certain learning patterns as? Pattern-matching? Inference? Or is it all just plain old stereotyping? Inference conjures the thought of machine learning models and generative AI. [Generating Barbies from various countries exposed the stereotypes](https://www.insider.com/ai-generated-barbie-every-country-criticism-internet-midjourney-racism-2023-7) and racism unchecked inference can lead to.
