[_Influence_](https://www.influenceatwork.com/) by Dr. Robert Cialdini covers some useful and intriguing psychological constructs that shape how we act in society. As I mention in my [previous post,](/2023/influence-or-persuasion/) one must take care in applying ethics to the situation and analyzing which subset of tactics is acceptable.

Below I walk through the book by chapter highlighting topics and examples that I found interesting.

### Chapter 1

One theme this book exposes is the subconcious things we would be surprised influence us but actually do. There are emperical studies throughout the book supporting the various points. Take these three requests in the context of waiting in line for a copier and asking to skip to the font.

- "Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I'm in a rush?" 94% success
- "Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine?" 60% success
- "Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I have to make some copies?" 93% success

One would assume that being in a rush would lead to a greater chance of skipping in line, but it really was the trigger word _because_.

Contrast principle: much more likely to purchase a $95 sweater after purchasing a $495 suit than the other way around. The same thing applies to realtors showing overpriced, dilapidated properties leading up to the "good" deal they want to sell their clients on. The contrast fresh in the client's mind makes him or her see the value of the final house after the setup sequence.

Another theme of the book is that humans use pattern matching and take shortcuts to make sense of the world. For example, expensive=good. If we analyzed everything from first principles every time, we would function at the speed required to make decisions in normal life. The obvious observation this raises is we generally think of stereotyping as bad, but this emotionless observation says it is required to function in life. I have some questions. Is there something else we can categorize certain learning patterns as? Pattern-matching? Inference? Or is it all just plain old stereotyping? Inference conjures the thought of machine learning models and generative AI. [Generating Barbies from various countries exposed the stereotypes](https://www.insider.com/ai-generated-barbie-every-country-criticism-internet-midjourney-racism-2023-7) and racism unchecked inference can lead to.

### Chapter 2

Reciprocation is a phenomenon that is common in American culture. When someone helps us out, we want to return the favor and help them in return. This can be a solid foundation of good working relationships and even friendships, or it can be manipulated out of balance. This is because the initiator chooses the both first favor and the requested return favor. The indebtedness can be exploited when the return favor is much larger than the original.

In [Luke 14:12-14,](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/LUK.14.12-14.ESV) Jesus says:

> He said also to the man who had invited him, “When you give a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return and you be repaid.
>
> But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the just.”

A variation on reciprocation of favors is reciprocal concession. In this scenario, the initiator does not give anything to start the process. He simply makes a large request, knowing the answer will probably be "no." The reciprocation comes into play with the followup request. The initiator's concession down to the smaller request will make the subject feel pressured to return the "favor" and concede by agree to the second proposition.

My kids have figured out this principle already! They will sometimes ask to bring a toy into whatever destination we are driving to. When I say no, they then ask to bring it but leave it in the van. I'm more likely to say yes due to the reciprocal concession principle. If they had led with their second request, I would have more likely said a flat no.

Here is the defense angle: don't eschew all favors as some will be genuine. Pay attention to if the requested reciprocation is substantially larger than first act or if negotiation ensues "walking down" to smaller and smaller concessions. Then you know it was a ploy from the beginning and do not need to feel indebted to repay what was given with ulterior motives.
