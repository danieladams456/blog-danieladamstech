Previously I shared a post [Staff Engineer Resources](/2023/staff-engineer-resources/) that included a collection of books, podcasts, and blogs I found helpful. That list was a snapshot in time, but I wanted to create a living page to track my reading. Both improving my writing and increasing my book reading are personal improvement goals of mine.

I like the "Reading," "Read," and "To Read" sections in Goodreads, but wanted a book list that fit the look and feel of the site more than their embedded widget. This made me think of the [Gatsby static site generator](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), which was built from the ground up to pull data in from other sources. A quick Google showed Goodreads actually [deprecated their API in 2020,](https://www.goodreads.com/api) several years ahead of Reddit and Twitter making similar moves recently [in response to LLM training.](/2023/the-fediverse-llms-and-rate-limiting/)

My new [book list/reading tracker](/book-list/) page is in the navigation bar links above!
