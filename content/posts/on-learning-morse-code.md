I have always been a nerd. As a kid, my first three big purchases with my own money were a pair of binoculars, Motorola walkie-talkies, and rechargeable batteries to power them. My brother and I played with those for years - at the house, at the park, and in many other settings. My introduction to ham radio was by reading Hardy Boys novels, including [The Short-Wave Mystery.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Short-Wave_Mystery) I also met someone that worked at [Trans World Radio](https://twr.org/) and showed me his mobile radio setup that could talk with South America.

In 2020, about 5 years after graduating college, I was looking for a hobby. The prior years had been busy with young kids and working hard on AWS and Red Hat certifications for work. Some friends were discussing what were the best radios for camping, and that triggered the thought I should get licensed and start playing with ham radio. After that, I channeled my energy into learning about radio. I couldn't just be an amateur radio operator, I had to get the highest license class. I couldn't just do any communication mode, I had to pick the most challenging one - CW or Morse code. I couldn't just be an average CW operator, I had to get to the top of the speed distribution! :-)

### Timeline of progress

- March 2020, literally a week before everything shut down due to COVID: I received my amateur radio license after passing the first two license levels (Technician and General)
- End of summer 2020: upgraded to Amateur Extra, the highest license class, when remote testing opportunities opened up
- February 2021: started learning Morse code on my own on the computer
- Fall 2021: joined [Long Island CW Club](https://longislandcwclub.org/) and started learning to head copy without writing anything down
- January 2022: [CWOps Academy](https://cwops.org/cw-academy/) Intermediate class with [John N8AA,](https://www.qrz.com/db/N8AA) 20 words per minute at the end
- Summer 2022: [CWOps Academy](https://cwops.org/cw-academy/) Advanced class with [Phil NE0S,](https://www.qrz.com/db/NE0S) 30 words per minute at the end
- Stable speed throughout 2023 as I ramped down intense practice. I can converse at ~35-40 wpm and contest at ~30 wpm.
